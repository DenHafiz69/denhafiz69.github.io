# My Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## ‚ú® About This Site

This is a static site generated by Hugo. The live site is served directly from the `/docs` folder in the `main` branch.

## üöÄ Local Development

To run this site locally, you'll need to have [Hugo installed](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DenHafiz69/denhafiz69.github.io.git
    cd denhafiz69.github.io
    ```

2.  **Update the theme submodule (if you just cloned):**
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

3.  **Run the local server:**
    ```bash
    hugo server -D
    ```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:1313/`.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Making Changes

2.  Run `hugo` to build the static files into the `/docs` directory.
