# Den Hafiz Personal Portfolio

This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio website, which is built with **Hugo** and deployed using **GitHub Pages**.

The main branch contains all the Hugo source files, and the compiled static site is served from the `/docs` folder.

## üöÄ Live Site

The portfolio is live and accessible here:

## üíª Running Locally (Unnecessary)

As this repository is primarily for deployment, there is generally **no need** to run the site locally unless you are contributing directly to the source code.
