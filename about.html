            <p>Hi, I’m Den Hafiz—a data scientist and machine learning researcher with a passion for advancing AI in healthcare and beyond. With a background in physics and hands-on experience in machine learning, I’m currently pursuing a master’s degree with a thesis on Development and Application of Deep Adversarial Model in Pneumonia Imaging. My work focuses on neural networks, deep learning, and adversarial techniques to enhance accuracy and efficiency in medical imaging, particularly in pneumonia detection from X-ray scans.</p>
            <p>I have developed a range of practical solutions, from building data analysis pipelines in Python and SQL to creating interactive projects using microcontrollers coded in C++. My journey has also taken me into web scraping, visualization, and machine learning for image classification, with a keen interest in transfer learning and GANs for data generation. Always eager to broaden my skills, I am currently exploring cloud computing and product development to make my solutions more scalable and accessible.</p>
            <p>Outside of research, I enjoy playing guitar, singing, and spending time with my cat. My goal is to combine my technical expertise and creativity to work on impactful projects, particularly in fields where technology can make a real difference. Let’s connect and collaborate!</p>
